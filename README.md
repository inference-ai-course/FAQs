## About
This project aims to collect and organize common questions and answers related to the core pillars of AI Engineering:
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Understanding the role of GPUs and CUDA in AI.
- **Programming Language**: Why Python is the de facto standard for AI.
- **Development Environment**: Setting up and using remote development tools effectively.

## Topics Covered
The FAQs cover three major topics:
1. **[GPU & CUDA](gpu-cuda/README.md)**: Why AI Inference/fine-tuning need GPU & CUDA.
2. **[Python](python/README.md)**: Why we use Python for programming for AI projects.
3. **[Remote Development](remote-development/README.md)**: How to use IDE tools to do remote developments.
