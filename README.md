## About
This project aims to collect and organize common questions and answers related to the core pillars of AI Engineering:
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Understanding the role of GPUs and CUDA in AI.
- **Programming Language**: Why Python is the de facto standard for AI.
- **Development Environment**: Setting up and using remote development tools effectively.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is designed to be a self-paced user manual for the AI Engineering program. You can navigate it in two ways:
1.  **Sequential Reading**: Start from the basics of Hardware and move towards Software and Development Environment.
2.  **Reference Guide**: Use the detailed topic links below to jump directly to the specific answer you need when you encounter a problem or concept gap.
